# Library App

Uses of different dependencies -

- express = server
- ejs = templating language
- express-ejs-layouts = to combine all html files into a layout file
- nodemon = allows us to automatically refresh/restart our server whenever we click save


- Routes are also known as Controllers
- In library-app/views/layouts/layout.ejs we store the boilerplate HTML that will be required by every page
- Creation of this layouts.ejs file is beneficial because if we want to change anything in our layout, we only have to make changes in a single file, rather than making changes one by one in all the files
- dotenv library allows us to use environment variables in our application
